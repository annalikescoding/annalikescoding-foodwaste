    <h2 id= "abouttext"> Hello! My name is Anna Lac, and this website was a project created for the Girls Who Code Pathways Program. I dedicated this project to raising awareness about food waste and the environmental impact it has. We often think that food waste can only be solved by reducing the amount of food we throw away, but there are many other ways to help reduce food waste. </h2>
